### How it works:
These Experiments are a small snapshot of an idea, they may not be complete and are intended to be examined, played with and built upon. They represent a theme or idea that you may find insightful of thought provoking

* Each branch of this repository represents a different experiment
* An experiment can contain any number of dependencies, e.g. Unity version, Render Pipeline, XR headset...
  * These will be listed in the branch Readme
* Experiments may contain 3rd party content that is shareable with a suitable license
* Due to the [BSD-3 License][bsd3], you may fork, clone, download, modify, build and share this content while following the terms of the license
