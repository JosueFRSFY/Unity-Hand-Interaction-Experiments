# Single Handed Menu
https://github.com/ultraleap/Unity-Hand-Interaction-Experiments/assets/17143693/a9322de1-f436-4652-abbd-d98144388f75

Single Handed Menu builds off existing the Hand Menu design paradigm, allowing you to detach the menu from the hand it is attached to.

This is useful for users who may not be able to use more than one hand - enabling a previously two-handed interaction to be usable with just one hand.

## Dependencies

- Ultraleap's [Interaction Engine](https://github.com/ultraleap/UnityPlugin) (included in the package manager via openupm).

## What is available?

- Tappable Physical Object script, allowing you to get tap events from objects tapped with physical hands
- Single Handed Menu - an object which uses grab balls and attachment hands to detach hand menus with a pull of the hand
  - Styled and unstyled prefabs for this
  - Two different visual ways of displaying the pullable tension - outlines, and line renderers

## This project was built with

* Unity 2022.3.9f1
*  Branched version of the Ultraleap Tracking Plugin 7.0.0 (via submoduled plugin)
* OpenXR
* URP
